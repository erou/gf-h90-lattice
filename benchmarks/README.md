# Benchmarks

The benchmarks are separated in two parts, the `solve_h90` part and the
`embed` part. The number in the name of the file is a reference to the
characteristic used during the benchmarks (*i.e.* the files `solve_h90-5.txt`
and `embed-5.txt` are timings of computations in characteristic 5.

## `Solve_h90`

The three columns correspond (from left to right) to:
1. the level of the algebra 
2. the degree of the algebra
3. the time that was needed to compute and decore the algebra

## `embed`

The five columns correspond (from left to right) to:
1. the level of the smaller algebra
2. the degree of the smaller algebra
3. the level of the bigger algebra
4. the degree of the bigger algebra
5. the time that was needed to embed the corresponding finite fields
